       "'Brought together by meaningful meals in the past and present, a doctor and a chef are reacquainted when they begin working at a hospice ward. From Sierra de las Minas to Esquipulas, explore Guatemala\\'s cultural and geological wealth, including ancient Mayan cities and other natural wonders. A goofy copywriter unwittingly convinces the Indian cricket team that she’s their lucky mascot, to the dismay of their superstition-shunning captain. Arranged to marry a rich man, young Ada is crushed when her true love goes missing at sea during a migration attempt – until a miracle reunites them. Nollywood star Ramsey Nouah learns that someone is impersonating him and breaks out of a mental institution to expose the imposter. Romance, mystery and adventure intertwine as a young man falls in love and a severed hand scours Paris for its owner in this mesmerizing animated film. The life and times of iconic South African liberation fighter Solomon Mahlangu, who battled the forces of apartheid, come into focus.

An arbitration panel is formed after a company CEO in Nigeria is sued for wrongful dismissal and rape by an employee with whom he had an affair. An optimistic farmer is determined to succeed in spite of the lack of rain in his region, and the sinking spirits around him. A grisly find atop a mountain in the French Pyrenees leads investigator Martin Servaz into a twisted dance with a serial killer in this icy thriller. A drama student is torn between creative possibility and ethical boundaries when his girlfriend\\'s family gets caught up in a sex scandal. When a power failure throws their suburban town into chaos, Matthew and his wife stoop to desperate measures to secure medication for their child. A bank heist takes an unnerving turn when the three sibling robbers attempt to gain entrance into an subterranean vault with sinister secrets. Personality differences, an old friend and a past flame poke holes in the way a husband and wife perceive their marriage. This cinematic journey into the waters off East Africa chronicles the story behind artist Damien Hirst\\'s massive exhibition of oceanic treasures. Trained dancer Vandana Hart travels the world to learn traditional and urban dance styles from the local experts who know them best. Thanks to an arranged marriage that was designed to make an ailing grandmother happy, newlyweds Rahul and Swati are virtually strangers. Can a four-day honeymoon make a difference when it comes to the couple\\'s feelings about each other?'"
